I'm a novice programmer. 
The main goal for me now is to find a field of software development that I really like, because when I do what I like, I become happy and full with energy. 
I am a second-year student at the university, where I have already worked in such programming languages as *Java, c/c++ and sql*. 
I like to study the mechanisms of everything that surrounds me: from the work of the human body to how the light bulb in my lamp lights up. 
I often had to work with information on the Internet to find answers to my questions, so I can confidently say that I have *the ability to self-educate*.

**Skills**:
* C/C++
* Windows Forms
* git
* Java
* SQL, SQLite
* Room for SQLite

**Tools**:
* Visual Studio
* IntelliJ idea
* Android Studio

The main part of my experience consists of studying at the University. 
I passed 2 term papers. 
The first is a console application for the store's warehouse. 
The warehouse has administrators and ordinary users, who have different options for editing the state of the warehouse.

The second is a windows application for solving the transport problem by the method of potentials.

**English**   
In *2018* I took an English course and got a **B2 level**.
